# From Scratch

What I cannot create, I do not understand

## Usage

### Building the book

If you'd like to develop and/or build the From Scratch book, you should:

1. Clone this repository
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` (it is recommended you do this within a virtual environment)
3. (Optional) Edit the books source files located in the `from_scratch/` directory
4. Run `jupyter-book clean from_scratch/` to remove any existing builds
5. Run `jupyter-book build from_scratch/`

A fully-rendered HTML version of the book will be built in `from_scratch/_build/html/`.
