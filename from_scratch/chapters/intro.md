# From scratch

> What you can't build, you do not understand - Richard Feynman

Every chapter in this book deep dives into one specific fundamental topic in computer science and tries to make a simple implementation of the idea from scratch. We'll start off with a problem and go through the journey of finding the details on the ideas behind the implementation.

All the implementations will be runnable python notebooks and at the end, we'll have a functional implementation of what we set out to build.

Here's a pretty ambitious checklist of what I intend to write on

- [ ] Event loop (chapter one, in progress)
- [ ] Hashing
- [ ] Encoding
- [ ] Asymmetric encryption
- [ ] DNS
